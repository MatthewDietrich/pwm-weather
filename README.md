Program to facilitate displaying weather information on gauges controlled by servos

This is for a project that my brother and I are working on. The ultimate idea is to have a wall-mounted board with several servo-controlled gauges that will display current weather conditions. The code will run on an Arduino with a Wi-Fi shield.
